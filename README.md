This Flask application serves as a comprehensive backend solution designed to manage task operations, user authentication, and notifications efficiently. It features a robust API that offers endpoints for adding, updating, retrieving, and deleting tasks, thereby facilitating seamless task management. User authentication is handled securely, ensuring that access is granted only to authorized users, while a detailed notification system keeps users informed about important events and updates related to their tasks. The application is integrated with a database, providing a reliable mechanism for storing and retrieving task-related information, which is essential for maintaining data integrity and supporting the application's core functionalities. This repository is structured to guide developers through setting up, running, and expanding the application, making it an ideal starting point for projects requiring a solid backend foundation.
